                <p class="para-font">Tron: The Upgrade (solo project) is a top down game where you can play up to 4 players and you 
                    have to make your friend hit the trail line that you have created and if you manage to pick up the power up, you 
                    can go invisible and avoid danger. This was created as part of a Digital Media coursework where the theme was upgrade, 
                    which was taking a classic game and add a feature that the original did not have; 
                    the game was created using Processing (Java) which featured the players, level and power-up.<br></p>

                <p class="para-font">
                        The idea of the game was taken from an original game, Tron and added a feature 
                        that the original did not have. The design aspect was to have roughly a four player 
                        feature with a pick up item feature of where the player would turn invisible and avoid 
                        any trails left by other players until there was only one winner.
                </p>

                <h2 class="subtitle-font">IMPLIMENTATION</h2>
                <p class="para-font">
                        For this project, it was written in Java and created a line objects using vectors, bike 
                        feature, simple GUI, where the player presses E to pause the game and SPACE to restart 
                        the game and etc. A control pad feature was added onto the game as well as it was difficult 
                        for four players to play simultaneously on one keyboard.
