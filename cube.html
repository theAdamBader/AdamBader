                    3x3x3 cube (solo project) is a physical project where a 3x3x3 LED cube has a variety of patterns that change 
                    depending on the individual’s position, this is achieved using machine learning (k-nearest neighbour algorithm) 
                    and three software (Arduino IDE, Processing and Wekinator). Arduino (C++) handles the hardware’s patterns and 
                    communicates with a Processing (Java) sketch that executes patterns depending on the features set on Wekinator; 
                    another Processing sketch handles the features and processes it through into Wekinator in which it learns the features 
                    and outputs to the Processing sketch that communicates with Arduino. This is achieved by having Wekinator communicating 
                    between both software using an OSC sender (input) and receiver (output).<br></p>

                <p class="para-font">
                    The design of the project was inspired by similar projects; however, none of them were interactive as mine. 
                    I started with the schematics for the project in which it needed a cover for the cube and the Arduino uno, 
                    I started with using a cardboard as it was an effective way to get the measurements correctly and quicker to 
                    laser cut to see. After the designing the correct measurements for the project, I started using plywood for the 
                    cube and a plastic cover, made using a 3D printer, to cover the Arduino uno.

                <h2 class="subtitle-font">IMPLIMENTATION</h2>
                <p class="para-font">
                    The implementation for this project involved using three different software: Processing, Arduino and Wekinator. 
                    Using Processing, I programmed a sketch that would run a pixelated video and a signal that would be called onto 
                    Wekinator as a feature that would be recorded and ran when the other sketch was complete; then programmed an Arduino 
                    sketch that would communicate with another Processing sketch and the Arduino hardware that would communicate and execute 
                    the pattern depending on the position of the individual. Once that was complete, Wekinator then communicated with two 
                    different Processing sketches, one was the pixelated video for the features using k-nearest neighbour algorithm and the 
                    other was a Processing sketch that would execute the output (patterns) depending on the recorded feature of the individual's 
                    position.
