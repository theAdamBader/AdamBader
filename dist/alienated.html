                <p class="para-font">Alienated (team project) is a 2D platform game in which you play as an antagonist 
                    who is being alienated by their own race (Hebi clan). The demonstrated gameplay is the 
                    first level where the character starts their killing spree, which you have to defeat the 
                    henchmen and a boss, that is why the level does not have that grim visualisation as it would 
                    have in other levels, if the game had further works to it. 
                    This game was created using Unity (C#) and Adobe Illustrator. <br>

                <p class="para-font">
                    The characters were designed using Adobe Illustrator creating a 32-bit pixelated 
                    characters where the characters each had their own movement, attacks and jump animation. 
                    Each animation required three to four frames to give it a smooth aesthetics <br><br>
                    The level design was a static image that was added onto a plane, on Unity, and the 
                    objects had a static texturing. 
                </p>

                <h2 class="subtitle-font">IMPLIMENTATION</h2>
                <p class="para-font">
                    The implementation for this project was using Unity’s inbuilt 
                    sprite animation and varies of C# scripts where each script are dealt with the character’s 
                    movements, attack system, collision, health and etc.<br><br>
                    There are three types of enemies that are implemented within the game, 
                    they are: a melee, a range and a mid-range boss.
