                        Finger gun (solo project) is a machine learning game in which the player 
                        uses their hands to aim at the enemies that are approaching the player. 
                        The game uses three different software: Unity, Processing and Wekinator. 
                        Wekinator communicates with Processing that handles the features of a hand 
                        skeleton (input) and Unity which handles the game (output) and grabs the 
                        hand mechanic features from Processing. The languages that this project 
                        uses were Java, JavaScript and C#. <br>

                <h2 class="subtitle-font">DESIGN</h2>
                <p class="para-font">
                    The design for this project was done via Unity's objects. The enemy was created 
                    using 5 sphere objects, one for the body, one as the ring, one for the eyeball 
                    and two for the eye shape; the textures for the game done on Photoshop and 
                    exported as a png to the 'Texture' file. The leap motion hand models were 
                    assets taken from the leap motion sdk. 
                    <br>
                    The level design was created using Unityâ€™s terrain tool that allows the user 
                    to create quick and simple assets such as mountains, trees and more. Created 
                    mountains and painted which grabs textures that were simply implemented from Photoshop.
                </p>

                <h2 class="subtitle-font">IMPLIMENTATION</h2>
                <p class="para-font">
                    The implementation for the project had a varies software and hardware that 
                    were used to create this project. The hardware needed for it was a leap motion 
                    to detect hand gestures; as for the software needed they were, Wekinator which 
                    records the features from Processing that the user sets (using the kNN algorithm), 
                    then runs the features to Unity, this works by having a oscillator that can 
                    communicate with the software that have the same signal.
